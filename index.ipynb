In practice, you would typically use a code library rather than writing linear regression code from scratch, but this is an exercise designed to help you see what is happening \"under the hood\".\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","* Perform a linear regression using self-constructed functions\n","* Interpret the parameters of a simple linear regression model in relation to what they signify for specific data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Simple Linear Regression Recap\n","\n","Remember that the ***data*** for a simple linear regression consists of $y$ (the _dependent_ variable) and $x$ (the _independent_ variable). Then the model ***parameters*** are the slope of the line, denoted as $m$ or $\\beta_1$, and the intercept ($y$ value of the line when $x$ is 0), denoted as $c$ or $\\beta_0$.\n","\n","Thus the overall model notation is \n","\n","$$y=mx+c$$\n","\n","or, alternatively\n","\n","$$y = \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 x $$\n","\n","In the example below, $c$ is equal to 15 and $m$ is equal to 3.\n","\n","In other words, the overall equation is $y=3x+15$.\n","\n","<img src=\"images/linregall.png\" width=\"650\">"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Finding Model Parameters\n","\n","If you think back to the basic algebra formulas, you might remember that slope can be calculated between two points by finding the change in y over the change in x, i.e. $\\Delta y / \\Delta x$. But now you are dealing with messy data rather than perfect abstractions, so your regression line is not going to represent the relationship perfectly (i.e. there is going to be some amount of _error_). The question is how to find the ***best fit*** line, rather than just calculating $\\Delta y / \\Delta x$.\n","\n","Because these are ***estimations***, we'll use the \"hat\" notation for the variables, i.e.\n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = \\hat{m} x + \\hat{c}$$\n","\n","or\n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1} x $$\n","\n","Everything in these equations represented with a \"hat\" (e.g. $\\hat{y}$ rather than just $y$) means that it is an estimate or an approximation. The only part that is not using this notation is $x$, because we have the actual data values for the independent variable.\n","\n","So, how do you find the line with the best fit? You may think that you have to try lots and lots of different lines to see which one fits best. Fortunately, this task is not as complicated as it may seem.
